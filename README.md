# DecisionTree-Project
The project aimed to develop a decision tree model to predict customer churn for a telecom company. The company was facing challenges with customer retention and wanted to identify factors that contribute to customer churn. The decision tree algorithm was chosen due to its interpretability and ability to handle both categorical and numerical features effectively.

The project followed the typical machine learning pipeline, which included data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Here are the key steps involved:

1.Data Collection: The telecom company provided a dataset containing customer information such as demographic data, usage patterns, customer service interactions, and churn labels.

2. Data Preprocessing: The dataset underwent preprocessing steps to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and handle outliers. Categorical variables were encoded into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

3.Exploratory Data Analysis: The dataset was analyzed to gain insights into the distribution of variables, identify correlations between features, and uncover any patterns related to customer churn. Visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices were used for this purpose.

4.Feature Engineering: Additional features were created or derived from existing features to improve the predictive power of the model. This could involve aggregating variables, creating interaction terms, or transforming variables to better capture relationships with churn.

5.Model Training: A decision tree classifier was trained on the preprocessed dataset using a suitable library such as scikit-learn. The decision tree algorithm recursively split the dataset based on the most informative features, creating a tree-like structure to make predictions.

6.Model Evaluation: The trained decision tree model was evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques like k-fold validation were used to assess the model's performance and ensure robustness.
